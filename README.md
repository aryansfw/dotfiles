# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles that I primarily use in Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2). Feel free to use this repository for inspiration (or not). :)

## Configuration files

My dotfiles consists of configuration files for:
- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim): a text editor
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): a terminal multiplexer
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship): a prompt styler
- .bashrc: bash script that runs on start
